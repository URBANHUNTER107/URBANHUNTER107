# 💫 About Me:
👋 Hi, I’m Farhan<br><br>I’m a BTech CSE student who’s genuinely curious about technology and enjoys exploring how different pieces of software work together. I love experimenting with code, learning new tools, and building things that help me understand concepts more deeply.<br><br>Currently, I’m focusing on frontend development using React, aiming to build full-stack applications and understand how real-world systems are designed end to end. Alongside this, I pay a lot of attention to writing clean, readable code and structuring projects properly.<br><br>Previously, I’ve worked on SQL-based projects and I genuinely enjoy playing with data — manipulating, cleaning, and analyzing datasets using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. Exploring different types of data and extracting insights from it is something I find both challenging and fun.<br><br>I’m open to collaborating on projects, beginner-friendly open-source work, and full-stack or data-related ideas where learning and curiosity come first. I’m also always eager to learn from others about best practices, project design, and industry expectations.<br><br>I enjoy continuously learning, experimenting with new technologies, and turning ideas or raw data into something meaningful 🚀
